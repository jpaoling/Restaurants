### 1. Problem 

I have decided to use data on inspections of restaurants in New York City to predict the outcome of an inspection using restaurant characteristics.

### 2. Client

The potential client is the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) in New York City. An accurate predictive model of the outcome of a restaurant inspection would allow the institution to focus their resources on the inspection of a smaller subset of establishments, namely those that have lower predicted grade.

### 3. Data

The DOHMH openly provides data on restaurant inspections. These include information on the restaurant, such as cuisine type, location, type of inspection and grade.

### 4. Approach

I will try to build a model to predict the outcome of an inspection, based on the eating establishment's characteristics.

### 5. Deliverables

The final product includes code, along with a slide deck.
