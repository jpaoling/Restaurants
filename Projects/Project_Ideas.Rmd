# My Idea

I would like to use data on restaurant inspections in NYC to predict, for a restaurant, the time until an inspection occurs. I would like to use open data provided by the Department of Mental Health and Hygiene (DOHMH) in New York City on restaurant inspections in NYC between 2011 and 2018.
